Data types:

Dynamic type language 
2 types:
1)primitive data type
2)non-primitive data type: objects, arrays

To check the data types- typeOf

1)primitive data type: predefined ; we can store single values
a)numbers: integers, floats
b)string: steams of characters enclosed in quotes---single, double, backtick quotes
c)Boolean: true or false
d)null: empty value or no value
e)undefined: declared variable with no value

a)numbers:1,-9.2,7.8
b)string: .single and double quotes work same
          .backticks was introduced in ES6 version
          it provides extra functionality; we can insert the variables into them.

String concatenation:

a=sai
b=kumar
age = 30

Ex 1 code: let a="sai"
           let b="kumar"
           let age=30
           console.log(`I am ${a+b}, my age is ${age} years old`)
           document.write(`I am ${a+" "+b}, my age is ${age} years old`)

o/p: I am sai kumar , my age is 30 years old.

Ex 2 code: let a="Reactjs"
           let b="sai kumar"
           console.log(`${a}=${b}`)
           document.write(`${a}=${b}`)


o/p: Reactjs student=sai kumar
